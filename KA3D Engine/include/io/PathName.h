/**
 * Class for manipulating path names.
 * The class overcomes problems caused by different path name separator characters and tricky manual iteration of name components.
 * Path name consists of optional drive letter and ':',
 * directories separated with '/' or '\' and
 * file name which consists of basename followed by '.' and suffix.
 *
 * PathName class is convenient for path name manipulation as name suggests.
 * For example if you have a directory name and you want to concatenate
 * a file name to it, you can write PathName(dirname,fname) without
 * need to check does the directory name already end with slash or backslash.
 * You can also retrieve directory name from file name by calling parent()
 * method, for example in a situation where you want to load textures
 * from the same directory as the filename.
