hgrviewer, version 1.0
----------------------


Overview
--------

The scene viewer shows scene hierarchy, geometry and 
key framed animations from a hgr scene file.


Usage
-----

There is three ways to view a scene:

1) Choose File->Open from menu

2) Drag-n-drop file to scene viewer window

3) Double-click hgr file to start scene viewer


Keyboard controls
-----------------

WASD                Move forward, left, backwards, right
Left/Right          Rotate left/right
Up/Down             Rotate up/down
Shift+Left/Right    Move left/right
Shift+Up/Down       Move up/down
1-9                 Select movement speed 1-9, default is 5
Pause/Break         Pause animation playback

F11+Shift           toggle sprite rendering pass on/off
F12+Shift           toggle glow rendering pass on/off
F5                  Refresh/reload scene file
F6                  Toggle rigid body simulation on/off
F8                  Cycle debug mode
F9                  Toggle record animation to hard disk


Debug modes
-----------

Following debug modes are available and cyclable by F8:
1) Default (no debug mode)
2) Render info
3) Bounding box visualization


About particle system support
-----------------------------

Particles can be put to scene nodes by using user property 'Particle=<name>',
see hgr file format and 3dsmax exporter documentation for details.

Particle file status is checked run-time if they are modified
while the scene is running, and modified files are loaded.
This way the user can edit particle system script in a text editor
while watching the changes immediately (upon saving) in the other window.


About rigid body physics support
--------------------------------

By using 'Physics=<x>', where <x> is box or sphere,
scenes with basic rigid body simulation can be created.

Other related user defined properties are 'Mass=<x>' and 'Density=<x>',
which both accept number as parameter. Mass and Density
are exclusive, i.e. only one of them can be used at the same object.


Summary of object properties (in 'User Defined' tab in 3dsmax)
--------------------------------------------------------------

- 'Particle=<name>' user defined object property can be used to 
  add particle systems parented to objects

- 'Collision=only' user defined object property can be used to add 
  static level collision objects which are not visible in the level
  
- 'Collision=none' user defined object property can be used to 
  add level objects which are not collided against. All objects
  which can never be collided against should be tagged this way.
  
- 'Physics=<x>', where <x> is box or sphere, enables rigid body
  physics for the object. Body size is computed automatically
  from object bounding box.
  
- 'Mass=<x>' sets total mass for the object when 'Physics=<x>' is 
  used. Note that 'Mass' and 'Density' are mutually exclusive.

- 'Density=<x>' sets size-relative mass for the object when 'Physics=<x>' is 
  used. Note that 'Mass' and 'Density' are mutually exclusive.
