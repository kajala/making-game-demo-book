The following sounds are the only ones we lack right now. That means you'd have to create them from scratch. 


*Vacuum noise for the Wobble creature -- He has a large vacuum hose that "Blows" air out trying to push main character off the Volcano

*Lava noise -- some sorta noise that would simulate lava flow and ambient lava (Movies like Volcano Tommy lee Jones)

*Beaming noise -- similar to Star Trek except cooler if possible. Zax(main character) beams in on a teleport pad.

*Generic Robot talk -- clanking and beeping
	*Happy
	*Mad
	*Dieing


That should be about it. Some of the sounds could just be tweeked a bit and would be 'legal' to be 
reused. So, that might make this easier to accomplish in such a short time. 


Thanks!
